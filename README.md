# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The aim of this project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The app will runs in the browser and features dynamic HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The application is designed to follow this criteria:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page

Here is an example of the application at work:
